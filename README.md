to achieve that i have created the Calculated field "Total Sales" which represent the total profit provided by the sales representatives.

So by using the Total sales field in our row we get the perfect analytic graph plot for the sales representatives who makes the most sales for the comapany:

From above Graph we can conclude that :

Matthew from Central region make the maximum sales with 3.1K.

Susan from East region make the maximum sales with 3.1K.

James from West region make the maximum sales with 1.3K.

These are the Top 3 Sales Representatives who will get the Bonus for this year.
